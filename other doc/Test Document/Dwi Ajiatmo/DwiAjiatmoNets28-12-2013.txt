Abstract 

Optimal performance value on a dc motor. The use of linear quadratic regulator (LQR) in the optimization 
of a DC motor speed control, based on the achievement of the weight matrix Q value and weight value matrix R. 
As a basis for determining the value of the feedback matrix K and the value of the tracking matrix L. From the 
simulation results on the tuning of the controller in DC motor speed control with linear quadratic regulator 
(LQR) obtained on condition that the Open Loop: Rise Time: 0, settling time:> 16.9 seconds, 0% Over shoot, 
PID: Rise Time: 0.0741, Settling time: 7.6 seconds, Over shoot: 90%, LQR: Rise time: 3.1, Settling Time: 5.62 
Over shoot: 0%.

1. Introduction 


That the most important part in the design of the 
control system performance specifications are stated 
correctly so as to produce an optimal control system 
for desired destination. The concept of optimization 
of the control system compromising performance 
index selection and design that will result in optimal 
control. Index performance is very important 
because it determines the nature and behavior so 
obtained optimal control, control may be obtained by 
linear, stationary, or time-varying, it all depends on 
the shape of the performance index. [7] 

 

2. Mathematical model of DC motor. 


In the IEEE dictionary mathematical model of a 
system is defined as a set of equations that are used to 
represent the physical system. [2] 

In many industries the world of DC motors are 
used. DC motor speed advantage is a better, simpler 
structure, higher reliability and easier maintenance. 
Characteristic equation of a DC motor is described as 
follows: [7]

LQR system is built by changing state space into 
the transfer function, from equation 1, 2, 3 and 4 
obtained by the DC motor mathematical modeling 
equations as follows:

That we know to be able to design a control 
system with linear quadratic regulator method, is the 
first step that we can describe a form of state space of 
a DC motor. Equation 5 and equation 6 can be a 
portrait of a state variable DC motor. [7]

a simulation and analysis.

3. Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) 


The technique of linear quadratic regulator 
design system is a part of a modern optimal control 
theory has been applied mainly in the industrialized 
world. [3-6] In general, the model state space system 
of equations is: [7]

.

Optimal design of a linear quadratic regulator 
control method is to reduce the performance index so 
that it has a minimum value to achieve the final 
performance can be accepted by the system. On the 
control of linear quadratic regulator design, 
performance index (J) is; 

 8 kxu..
.

Where K is the optimal feedback gain matrix and 
determine minimizing the performance index in 
equation (9). Feedback gain matrix K depends on the 
matrix A, B, Q, and R. There are two main equations 
that must be taken into account to achieve the 
feedback gain matrix K is the equation:

Where P is a symmetric positive definite matrix 
and the known solutions Algebraic Riccati Equation 
(ARE), the feedback gain matrix K is:

Substituting equation 10 into equation 7 derived:

.

By using a matlab program from the state matrix 
equation 7 can be searched DC motor speed control 
behavior. Large dimensions of the matrix Q based on 
the number of auto-dimensional state matrix A and 
matrix Q is the identity matrix of dimension 2 x 2 
matrix, and the dimension of the matrix R is based on 
the number of entries of the matrix B, where the 
matrix R is a constant equal to 1.
